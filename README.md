# DataUtilities

This framework contains non-UI helpers used across my apps. These should ultimately be moved into their own libraries for third party consumption. However, they are now open source in their current state.

In here, you will find things like:
* `Bonjour` - Discover hosts on the network using NSNetService
* `In-App Purchases` - Methods to handle and verify in-app purchases
* `Result` - Much-needed Result type for Swift
* `OrderedDictionary` - Data structure like a Dictionary, but with ordered keys
* `Errno` - Convert C-style `errno` values to Swift errors
